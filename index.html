                    Studying the thermal performance of Double Skin Facades (DSFs) with vertical layers has dominated the literature, however, there is still a lack of in-depth research on the performance of DSFs with atypical geometries such as folded cases which can be applied to Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) systems to improve their performance. To this end, the study evaluates the influence of the fold geometry on heat transfer, flow structure, and airflow rate in the Folded DSF cavities under a hot climate in Iran using an efficient method titled “patching”; the method integrates Soltrace3 with a 2D steady-state CFD model by ANSYS-Fluent. The results show that the fold position and its depth can alter the DSFs performance significantly; the higher the fold depth the more distortion of the flow field inside the cavity; from a practical perspective, the fold position in the upper part of the cavity is suitable for BIPVs application since it can capture 250% higher amount of solar radiation compared to a conventional vertical-layer DSF as the Base Case; the net heat gain through outer layer could improve with increase of fold depth and reach at least 33% higher than the Base Case, meanwhile, the total electricity generation potential of folded cases could be up to 169% higher than the Base Case; thus, the study proved that if the architectural design is of interest, it is highly recommended to consider folded DSFs as a design option.

                    As the world’s population becomes increasingly urbanized, the building sector is expected to consume even more energy and resources, exacerbating environmental damage. Life cycle Inventory Assessment is one of the main stages of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and it is a methodology for quantifying environmental impacts of buildings and other assets on the environment. We propose a literature review for examining the potential for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve LCA of buildings. In particular, by incorporating AI into the process, it is checked that a more accurate predictive modelling is enabled and time needed for data gathering can be reduced. However, it is also noted that many challenges remain and must be still addressed, such as the need for standardized data and the risk of bias in AI algorithms. Despite these latter open challenges, it can be concluded that AI has potential to significantly enhance sustainability in the building sector.

                    The demand for housing and the expansion of urbanization have increased the price of land and vertical growth of buildings, resulting in converting the courtyard and porch to balconies. Nowadays, semiopen spaces, which play a critical role in providing optimal indoor air and thermal conditions, are neglected. In addition, the area of such spaces is regarded as limited and sometimes even the balcony is eliminated, leading to improper thermal behavior and increased energy consumption, while such elements can be used for better natural ventilation of spaces and utilization of natural energy, resulting in reducing energy consumption in addition to controlling the pressure created by the wind in the case of correct design. The purpose of the current paper is to evaluate the performance of balconies on the high-rise buildings using single-sided ventilation in the harsh hot-arid climate of Hamdan in Iran, which there has not been studied already A general basic model is presented according to field studies and criteria. Field survey indicates that most of the high-rise buildings in Hamedan have single-sided natural ventilation, as well as are located on the south side, have a rectangular shape, are enclosed on three sides, and have recessed balconies. Based on the climate data of Hamedan, July is considered the hottest month of the year, during which natural ventilation should be applied. Simulation is conducted by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method and ANSYS software. Based on the results, 4.5 m width and 1.5 m depth are regarded as the best geometry of the balcony for Hamedan providing a mass flow rate up to 1.38 kg/s. In addition, the position of the balcony in the wall of the building should not be symmetrical. The usage of a balcony in the middle of the façade could provide higher ventilation rate and reduce cooling energy up to 7% compared with the base case. Through a meticulous balcony design, wind could path through the larger spaces then it is led towards the opposite window, and finally exits the building in a single-sided ventilation mode. This causes the air to flow in most of the interior spaces, leading to better ventilation than other methods.

                    The CFD simulation accuracy mostly depends on the appropriate setting of boundary conditions and numerical simulation parameters. This study shows the influence of two types of boundary condition settings on the CFD simulation results of Double-Skin Facade (DSF) for a specific problem. These two boundary settings are the constant temperature on the DSF surfaces called Boundary A, and Boundary B is defined via solar radiation using the Discrete Ordinate radiation Model (DOM). The paper verified both the numerical simulations using the experimental data. Comparing the numerical results of two types of boundaries with experimental data shows that both cases underestimated the values lower than 5.2 K and 0.1 m/s for the temperature and velocity respectively at the regarded measured points. Boundary A gives more accurate temperature prediction results, while Boundary B shows velocity magnitude closer to the measurements in the middle height of the cavity; the average temperature and velocity differences between the two boundary types are 0.6 K and 0.003 m/s respectively which are negligible. Finally, the selection of boundary conditions depends on study purposes, however, when the DSF is equipped with blinds and if there is not enough data in hand but the exact value of solar irradiation, using the Boundary B approach is suggested; it can provide reasonable results associated with multi-type of thermal boundary conditions at the same time. Furthermore, if the goal is to investigate the flow pattern in the DSF, Boundary B is argued to perform better than the constant temperature boundary conditions.

                   Numerous studies have only focused on vertical air channel performance, but there is still a need to perform in-depth research on the flow and heat transfer characteristics of atypical double skin façade (DSF) such as folded cases. A 2D steady-state numerical study was conducted using ANSYS-Fluent 18 to evaluate the impact of four inclination angles and fold positions on DSF thermal performance. The simulation data were compared with a typical validated vertical DSF as the base case. The folded DSFs could decrease the average cavity and surface temperature by 2.4 °C through improving natural convection. The folded cases enhanced the airflow rate up to 27% higher than the base case supporting the folded geometries for building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) DSF application.

                   The main idea of designing buildings with double skin facades is to achieve sustainable architectural goals. Considering the importance of reducing energy consumption in buildings as well as various factors preventing energy loss, it is regarded that how deep the cavity between double skins is in most appropriate building with double skin façade in a particular climate in terms of optimal use of heating and cooling energy, and it is determined that how much energy is used by each floor in the building to meet the residents’ comfort. The method used in this research is modeling and software calculations. A chamber with the length of 5 m, the width of 4 m and height of 3 m in three floors with double skin facades at 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 cm depths was modeled to be compared with a single skin façade using ECOTECT 10. After defining it in the Energy Plus software, cooling and heating load of the chamber was analyzed. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the thermal performance of double skin facades with different depths in the climate of Karaj city. First, the validity of ECOTECT and Energy Plus software was investigated, and then the results were obtained regarding the use of double skin façade compared with the simple façade. The results showed DSFs have a great ability in order to minimize cooling and heating load during operation periods of building even in hot climates such as Tehran. Finally, comparing heating and cooling energy consumption for all depths with respect to environmental factors, it was annually selected that double skin façade with a depth of 20 cm is the best option which results in about 34% reduction in energy consumption.

                  Vernacular architecture in each climate had always been in harmony with its surrounding in all micro-climates. The typology, configuration, and skeleton of the regraded architecture are trying to respond to the environmental condition and provide a beneficial comfort zone and humanitarian relief. In this perspective, conserving the buildings from unwanted cold and harsh hot air has been one of the priorities of vernacular buildings as a passive design. The envelope of each building provides a barrier between inside and outside and has a significant impact on reducing energy consumption in it. In hot and humid climates, some general techniques could help energy efficiency performance of buildings; they are namely: thick urban texture, semi-closed urban spaces, and expansion along the coastal line encountering the sea and using large and wide paths. Some physical and formal features of the hot and humid climate are inner court, shading and cross ventilation, high ceilings and large windows, semi-open spaces called "Ivans," and basement-removed spaces. However, it has not been studied those vernacular buildings envelope performance in energy consumption to improve IAQ in hot and humid climates. This quantitative study tries to assess a Bushehr vernacular home by simulating its energy performance by introducing related boundary conditions using the Design-Builder simulation tool. The openings of the Rashidy home import maximum light and temperate air to the inside and reduce cooling loads efficiently. Using numerical analysis, it was also shown that the openings substantially provide indoor thermal comfort by their position, sizing, and configuration in two-scale urban and building scales. The CFD analysis in the two mentioned scales somewhat proved and validated the primary purpose of vernacular architects and their efficient thinking. The first raw results show that studies of vernacular buildings can lead us to more efficient design in the future.

                  Today, with the increasing need for housing and considering the energy crisis and environmental problems, considering the construction of buildings to reduce energy consumption are more important than ever and indigenous architecture as symmetry architecture with climate has provided fundamental solutions. This study aimed first at investigating the climatic indigenous architecture principals of Oramanat in the western part of Iran as a simulation - case study and tries to answer the question “How has local housing in Oramanat region fulfilled its climatic needs?” and “in what ways has this goal been achieved?” Assuming the indigenous architecture is responsive to environmental issues, so in the process of research, it turns into an independent central element. The library and Internet resources and field studies with quantitative and analytical - descriptive approach were first done to collect the required data and study the case studies. Then, the findings were classified into three key stages of comfort, heating and cooling performance by simulating the case study in the environment of Desgn buider2.5 software. Finally, research resulted in common strategies among mountainous villages in Oramanat region for more symmetry architecture with the climate of the region.

                  Nowadays, one of the main questions of designers is about the consequences of their activities on the natural environment; that is how the built environment should be designed not to have adverse effects. Due to the energy and environmental crisis conditions of the present age, it is essential that instead of imitating the techniques of sustainable architecture, to be dealt with a more radical we have to look for an answer, not in the design itself but in the point of view to that. The reason for existing architecture instability can be connected to the lack of designers' sufficient knowledge of the current situation and the inability to categorize and organize their vast architectural information with sustainability principles. The problem could be related to a deficiency in a specific design process and the designers' lack of a holistic and sustainable design approach. Appropriate educational or commercial architecture design requires an accurate and systematic process from beginning to end. The main question of this research, which is a logical argument with a qualitative-interpretation approach used by a library study, is how to specify the design's path and promote the theoretical foundation step by step to develop suitable architecture. The primary assumption in this research is how the design principles are more accurate and predetermined; consequently, the results are more desirable. Such principles could be addressed by ecological design. The objective of this work is to present a procedure of modern sustainable architectural design with the title of ecological design introduced by Malaysian architecture Ken-Yeang. Based on the mentioned method, the design process was presented in form of a step-by-sept design process to make the designer capable of the accurate and classified design.

                  Education of sustainable architecture seeks proficiencies for students to design buildings with high energy efficiency since, in the current situation, environmental problems have attracted a lot of attention. Studies all over the world demonstrate that the best way of saving energy through architecture is by designing buildings with high energy efficiency in the light of appropriate and reasonable education. Studies all over the world have suggested that in order to reduce the effects of pollution caused by non-appropriated architecture, education and presenting main solutions for improving its methods should be considered as an educational program or educational method. This education usually starts from undergraduate programs. But in Iran, all efforts are summarized in one or two credit courses, which is inadequate for gathering knowledge about new energies for a bachelor. So, it seems that cognition of the current situation and deficiencies is necessary. The main question of this study is to what extent sustainable subjects take into consideration Iranian universities’ Curricula and to what context the current problems are related. The solution could be found in the content of subjects related to nature and energy. Today, with an emphasis on sustainable development and coexistence with the environment, education in various sectors of applied science has found its direction, and the result of this attitude can be seen in the educational system of developed countries. Education can have the most important role in promoting and implementing environmental sustainability issues correctly. Educating sustainability topics is a new field that has only a little part of common education courses. The purpose of this qualitative case study is to investigate the importance and placement of environmental sustainability subjects since educating sustainability topics is a new field that has only a little part of common educational courses in Iran. In other words, this case study research investigates the importance and position of courses related to sustainability and their application in architectural design projects. Using the attributive method, we compare the subjects approved by the Ministry of Science with three successful foreign universities in terms of education on environmental sustainability to extract problems and present suggestions. Results indicate that students’ level of satisfaction with the content and applicability of issues related to environmental sustainability in the undergraduate curriculum is low, and sustainability topics do not have an appropriate position in the educational system of architecture, so it is necessary to review the presentation of these courses. It seems that new topics and courses such as energy economy and energy policies should be considered for architects and engineers to cover the main subjects in energy decision-making. Because sustainable architecture is a pervasive issue and is not only dedicated to issuing of reducing energy and materials consumption. There are fields like architectural technology, green architecture, smart architecture and also environmental design, behavioral architecture, economy-oriented architecture, and so on. The seminal result of this study revealed that academic education in the bachelor of the architecture needs to be more attended than before, especially in terms of sustainability.

                 Architectural space, organizes the human life. Assessing and prioritizing the effective criteria in designing architectural space could be also effective on designer’s decision to improve the qualitative elements of space and provide the necessary physical utilities for its inhabitants or potential users. The public libraries by responding to cultural capitation, and as major sources of public education are promoting public knowledge and playing an important role in attracting maximum number of people. In each architectural space, physical elements have been considered as main factors to shape the space. Space is one of the elements in architectural design which is considered continuously in both theory and profession. People perceive the architecture by space and recognize it by form and these two parts of architecture have inherent relationship with each other and therefor enrichment of space comes from the composition of physical elements. In other words, the Interconnectedness between essence of space and physical elements have been recognized as main parts of architectural process. Quality is a sophis ticated subject in architecture which in different situations gets disparate definitions. Quality is one of the accepted ideal of analysis and perceiving architectural projects. Quality of subject indicates the transcendence, similarity or inferior of subject in comparison with other subjects. Perceiving the superior or inferior quality of subjects could be accomplished by a subjective or objective process. Improving the quality of architectural space could have a major effect on sense of user and it could influence the user's satisfaction during the exis tence of a certain space. There are lots of s trategies to obtain high qualities in spaces such as increasing flexibility, multifunctioning the space, introducing active and passive spaces in architecture, promoting transparency, porosity, fluidity, and drawing connections between indoor and outdoor spaces. The main purpose of this s tudy is to find the criteria that promotes the quality of architectural space in libraries. This analysis-descriptive research has been done with a quantitative approach, by using factor analysis and SPSS20 software for balancing and reduction of measures in order to gain a desirable design in connection with the supply of user’s satisfaction of architectural space. In this research, forming out questionnaires for the case s tudy was necessary to achieve the aforementioned purposes. The population who participated in this research consisted of selected Hamadan library users, including men and women in the age range of 18-35 years old, who were observed carefully in a period of 4 months. According to s tatis tical methods, sample size was 226 and the type of sample selecting method was random sampling. With this arrangement, special physical specifications of central library of Hamadan as an exis ting and viable sample of cultural space in a city  among 10 factors in improvement of special qualities in libraries, attention to view and vegetarian covering, interior lighting and the proportion in design are the mos t important factors that should be the main priorities for interventions, in order to supply the desirable study room.
